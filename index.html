        <h2>What Bag Should You Get?</h2>
        <p>There are lots of bags to choose and ultimately will be up to you. The best thing to remeber is to not get anything
          more than 45L (or if you go to a lot of small European countries, 35L). You'll want something durable and won't stick out (Tortuga Outbreaker or the Minaal are some)
        Good Choices </p>

        <h2>What Chothes You Get?</h2>
        <p>Stay simple. When traveling to foreign countries, you don't want to stand out too much (pickpocketers and all).
          You need about four or five shirts...max! Two pairs of pants and maybe a pair of shorts if it'll be a warm place. Most places yo can
        easily wash your clothes. Think of how you might dress on weekend, use that philosophy!  </p>

        <h2>What Shoes should You Get?</h2>
        <p>Comfy shoes. You'll be going through airports a lot, so you'll need make sure that whatever you get is easy to take off (Trust me on this one)
          Make sure they also fit the activities you'll be doing. If you are going to hike some trails...then get shoes for that  </p>
